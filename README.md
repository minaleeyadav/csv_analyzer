What is CSV Analyzer?
CSV Analyzer is a web application built with Django that allows users to:

Upload CSV files.
View the first few rows of data.
Calculate summary statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.
Identify and handle missing values.
Generate visualizations, such as histograms, to better understand the data distribution.
How Did I Achieve This?
To create CSV Analyzer, I followed these steps:

Project Setup:

Started by setting up a new Django project and app within it. This involved creating a virtual environment, installing Django, and configuring the settings.
File Upload Feature:

Implemented a form that allows users to upload CSV files. The files are temporarily stored on the server for processing.
Data Processing:

Used the pandas library to read the uploaded CSV files. Implemented basic data analysis features like displaying the first few rows, calculating summary statistics, and identifying missing values.
Data Visualization:

Integrated seaborn and matplotlib to generate basic plots, such as histograms, for numerical columns. These visualizations are displayed on the web page to provide a clear view of the data.
User Interface:

Designed a user-friendly interface using Django templates. The results of the data analysis and visualizations are presented in an organized manner, making it easy for users to interpret the data.
Setup Instructions
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
pip: The Python package manager, which should come with Python.
Virtual Environment: Optional but recommended for managing dependencies
